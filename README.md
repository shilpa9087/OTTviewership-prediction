# 🎬 OTT Viewership Prediction – ShowTime

## 📌 Objective  
Predict first-day viewership of content to optimize scheduling and marketing decisions for OTT platforms.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques
- **Linear Regression**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Sparse Categorical Data**
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

---

## 🔍 Key Challenges
- Dealt with **sparse categorical variables** using effective encoding techniques
- Applied **feature selection** to reduce noise and improve prediction accuracy
